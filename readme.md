## 1. Executive summary

This report indicates major points of developing a brand new website which presents for a cafe named “A little Hanoi”. The objective of the project is to bring about a Progressive Web App which meets the usability angle as well as the aesthetic perspective. Besides, promoting the SEO’s ranking is also concerned.

The ideal website is the one which has 5 pages including Our story, Menu, Webshop, Contact us and Blog. Each product is equipped with name, price and image. The blog page covers information of new product coming and knowledge of coffee, tea and cake. Besides, the logo of the cafe needs to be produced. The website is able to link to external social media channels of the cafe like Facebook and Instagram.

The biggest challenge should be implementing the Webshop page. Because it requires knowledge of backend fields like security and payment system. Additionally, front-end development skills are essential to turn the good design into a real web page smoothly. Finally, using a Content Management System is a recommendation to facilitate content management.

## 2. Audiences, mission, and vision

### AUDIENCE
The audience is divided into 2 segments. The first one is youth whose ages ranges from 20 to 25. They like exploring different cafes and usually search on the website to find out the new ones. The second segment is from 25 to 40 years old who have stable jobs. They are passionate about coffee and interested in researching information related it. They are also the loyal customers of the cafe who frequently order products from the website.

### MISSION
The website aims to promote the “A little Hanoi" cafe. It provides the details of the cafe such as menu, location and story. Furthermore, the Webshop page is built to sell highlight products of the cafe. Therefore, a specific introduction of the cafe is necessary to make the cafe stand out and details of products including text, images, prices are supposed to be on the Webshop page.

### VISION
Apart from promoting the cafe, the website is expected to become a particular channel where people are able to search for knowledge relating to coffee, tea, cake and, especially, Vietnamese cuisine through blog posts. In other words, it is about sharing culture.


## 3. Architectural strategies and approaches

The front page of the website is the gateway to access all information placed on the website. It will include the following global navigation:
• Our story: In this site, the story of "A little Hanoi" from scratch will be shown in an attractive way.
• Menu: This page presents a list of selections available in the cafe.
• Webshop: The place where customers can order blended coffee and souvenir items with delivery service.
• Contact us: Contact information and a form for leaving feedback are shown here.
• Blog: The page covers information of new product coming and knowledge of coffee, tea and
cake.
The organization scheme is subjective. It follows the logic: a new user comes to my site, he wants to know briefly about my cafe then he browses the Menu as well as the Webshop. If the user has any questions he can reach us directly through "Contact us”. Blog page is further informative entries.

## 4. Technologies 

The website is built using React, Redux, Bootstrap 4.
