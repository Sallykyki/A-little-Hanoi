## 1.Executive summary

This report indicates major points of developing a brand new website which presents for a
Vietnamese cafe named “A little Hanoi”. The objective of the project is to bring about a
responsive website which meets the usability angle as well as the aesthetic perspective.
Besides, promoting the SEO’s ranking is also concerned.

The ideal website is the one which has 5 pages including Our story, Menu, Webshop, Contact
us and Blog. Each product is equipped with name, price and image. The blog page covers
information of new product coming and knowledge of coffee, tea and cake. Besides, the logo of
the Cafe needs to be produced. The website is able to link to external social media channels of
the Cafe like Facebook and Instagram.

The biggest challenge should be implementing the Webshop page. Because it requires
knowledge of backend fields like security and payment system. Additionally, front-end
development skills are essential to turn the good design into a real web page smoothly. Finally,
using a Content Management System is a recommendation to facilitate content management.

## 2. Audiences, mission, and vision

### AUDIENCE

The audience is divided into 2 segments. The first one is youth whose ages ranges from 20 to

25. They like exploring different cafes and usually search on the website to find out the
new ones. The second segment is from 25 to 40 years old who have stable jobs. They are
passionate about coffee and interested in researching information related it. They are also the
loyal customers of the cafe who frequently order products from the website.

MISSION
The website aims to promote the “A little Hanoi" cafe. It provides the details of the cafe such as
menu, location and story. Furthermore, the Webshop page is built to sell highlight products of
the cafe. Therefore, a specific introduction of the cafe is necessary to make the cafe stand out
and details of products including text, images, prices are supposed to be on the Webshop page.


### VISION

Apart from promoting the cafe, the website is expected to become a particular channel where
people are able to search for knowledge relating to coffee, tea, cake and, especially,
Vietnamese cuisine through blog posts. In other words, it is about sharing culture.

## 3. Lessons learned

Almost users tend to use their smartphones to check a new coffee shop. It is the easiest and
fastest way when they are out. Therefore, the website is firstly mobile friendly. Besides, it is the
large website which includes Webshop so that some content needs to be eliminated in mobile in
order to optimise insight speed of the website. Furthermore, it is advantageous to think about
using flexible images when implementing a responsive website. And it is essential to consider
how to enhance loading times of the website.

## 4. Architectural strategies and approaches

The front page of the website is the gateway to access all information placed on the website. It
will include the following global navigation:

- Our story: In this site, the story of "A little Hanoi" from scratch will be shown in an attractive
    way.
- Menu: This page presents a list of selections available in the cafe.
- Webshop: The place where customers can order blended coffee and souvenir items with
    delivery service.
- Contact us: Contact information and a form for leaving feedback are shown here.
- Blog: The page covers information of new product coming and knowledge of coffee, tea and
    cake.

<meta name="author" content="A little Hanoi">

<meta name="description" content="Let yourself wander in an ancient corner of Hanoi located
in the center of Helsinki. Taste the coffee and feel the soul in A Little Hanoi.">

<meta name="keywords" content="Vietnamese coffee, egg coffee, cafe, homemade cake,
handmade decoration, vintage style, ancient Hanoi, Helsinki">


The organization scheme is subjective. It follows the logic: a new user comes to my site, he
wants to know briefly about my cafe then he browses the Menu as well as the Webshop. If the
user has any questions he can reach us directly through "Contact us”. Blog page is further
informative entries.

## 5. Content management

Apart from the basic information of the cafe, the content on the site is frequently updated,
especially on the Webshop page and Blog page. Hence, using a Content Management System
such as WordPress or Magento is considered to enable owner to add new content and edit
existing content when needed with the use of an effective visual editor, as opposed to having to
manually write lines of code.
